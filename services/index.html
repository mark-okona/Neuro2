                <p>It can be difficult to know what neuropsychology support you need. To help, Neuropsychological Health provides a consultation model, whereby you can avail of a 1 to 1.5-hour online consultation.

                    <p>A neuropsychological assessment is a detailed evaluation of your memory, concentration, language, and other cognitive skills. These assessments are helpful if you have concerns about your thinking and cognitive abilities, providing detailed information about cognitive strengths and difficulties. Neuropsychological assessments typically start with an online consultation following a letter of referral from a GP or Medical Consultant. Neuropsychology Health offers two types of assessment: a screening assessment and a full assessment. A screening assessment may incorporate up to four to five hours of evaluation, while a full neuropsychological evaluation typically takes between seven to nine hours.</p>
                    <p>Neuropsychology Health can also provide assessment and vocational rehabilitation-focused support sessions for people with brain injury and neurological illnesses planning their return to work.</p>

                    <p>Neuropsychological assessments to aid in the diagnosis of dementia can be provided by Neuropsychology Health. We can also assess your cognitive functioning after receiving a diagnosis, should you wish to understand more about your cognitive abilities and how to manage any changes you have noticed. Please note that a diagnosis of dementia must be made by a suitably qualified medical professional such as a neurologist, Medicine of the Elderly Consultant, or a GP. They may request a neuropsychological assessment to assist in making a diagnosis. To ensure the assessment is as helpful as possible, a short referral letter from your neurologist, Consultant, or GP is required. If a diagnosis has been made, you can self-refer for a neuropsychological assessment and report. These assessments will also start with an online consultation unless this is not suitable for the client.</p>

                    <p>Neuropsychology Health offers psychological therapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation sessions for adults adjusting to brain injury and neurological illness. It can be very difficult to come to terms with and adapt to the changes involved in living with a neurological condition. You may experience several losses (e.g., loss of independence, loss of physical abilities), which can affect your confidence in coping with everyday life. Commonly reported emotional and behavioral difficulties can include feelings of low mood or depression, anxiety, worry, frustration, or anger.</p>
                    <p>Neuropsychological rehabilitation aims to help individuals manage and come to terms with changes following a brain injury or neurological condition. Neuropsychology Health provides specialist cognitive rehabilitation with a therapeutic focus, integrating psychological support. You will receive psychological support while developing new skills to manage cognitive challenges. We also provide specialist psychological support for adults experiencing trauma related to brain injury or neurological illness.</p>
